# oneHundredDaysOfCode

This repository will follow my journey as I complete the 100 Days of Code course by Dr. Angela Yu

I am an intermediate programmer so I opted to just do all of the projects in VS Code and run them manually from the terminal.
I completed some of the excercises in the web-based IDEs such as auditorium and replit but completed all of the daily projects and a some of the more difficult excercises in their own python files. They can be found in the scripts folder.

## 3/3/24:
Completed projects Day 1 - Day 4:

6.) Escaping The Maze : This mini-project was completed on "Reeborg's World" and helped reinforce the idea of how while loops are used. I used the built in functions in the game to allow the character to solve the maze no matter where it starts in the maze or what direction it initially faces.
